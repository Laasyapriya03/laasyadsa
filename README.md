smart home automation with machine learning
q learning algorithm using linked list
q learning algorithm
 Q(State,Action)=(1-)*Q(State,Action)+*(Reward+*
 max(Q(nextState,
 alloctions)))
 where:(alpha)
 is
 the learning rate. (gamma) is the discount factor.
 Q(State,Action)is the Q-value for the State-Action Pair.
 Reward is the feedback received from the user. nextstate
 is the state after taking the choosen action.
 Repeat: Repeat the learning process over multiple itera
tions.
 Adaptive Lighting:
 Use the learned Q-values to determine the optimal action
 for adjusting the brightness based on the current state
